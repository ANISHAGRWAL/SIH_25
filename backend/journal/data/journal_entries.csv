22,2025-09-01,aryan,"I woke up late again today, skipped breakfast, and dragged myself to the 8 AM class—half present, half zoned out. Everyone seems to get the lectures except me, and I don’t even have the courage to ask questions. I laughed along with a few classmates just to blend in, but inside I felt empty. Lunch was another skipped meal—I wasn’t really hungry, or maybe I just didn’t feel like sitting around people. Lab sessions were stressful; I barely understood the assignment and copied most of it. I wanted to call my parents but didn’t know what to say. I keep lying to them that things are fine. I scroll through reels and act like everything’s okay, but it’s not. I feel like I’m falling behind—academically, socially, mentally. Everyone looks like they’re moving forward, while I’m stuck pretending to be fine. I don’t know how long I can keep this up."
23,2025-09-02,aryan,"I thought maybe today would be better, but it wasn’t. I sat through lectures again, nodding as if I understood, but my notes are still just random words. A group from my class asked if I wanted to join their project team, and I said no — not because I didn’t want to, but because I didn’t think I’d contribute anything. I watched from a distance as they laughed and discussed things I couldn’t relate to. I avoided calls from home and stared at my assignment for hours before submitting an incomplete version. Nights feel the worst — quiet, long, and heavy."
24,2025-09-03,aryan,"Midweek, and I already feel drained. My attendance is dipping, but I can’t bring myself to care. I woke up and just stared at the ceiling for almost an hour. When I finally got up, the day felt like a blur. The class was talking about an upcoming coding contest. I smiled and pretended to be interested, but I know I won’t participate. I feel out of place even in my own branch. I used to love computers, but now I don’t even want to open my laptop. Everyone thinks I’m just quiet, but they have no idea what’s going on inside."
25,2025-09-04,aryan,"I skipped the first lecture today. Honestly, I didn’t feel like facing anyone. I sat alone at the back of the library for a while, just hiding behind a book I wasn’t reading. My roommate asked if I was okay — I told him I was just tired. It’s easier to lie than explain feelings I don’t fully understand myself. I keep thinking maybe I’m just being dramatic, maybe I’m weak. But this constant heaviness, the way I can’t focus, can’t talk, can’t smile genuinely — it’s real. I wish someone would notice without me having to explain."
26,2025-09-05,aryan,"Classes ended early today, and everyone went out for chai and samosas. I wanted to join but couldn’t get myself to move. I watched them from my window, laughing like everything’s fine. I miss feeling like that. I finally opened up a YouTube tutorial and tried coding something small, and for a moment, I felt… not happy, but focused. It didn’t last long, but it was better than nothing. Maybe I need help. Maybe I should talk to someone. But the thought of even starting that conversation makes my chest tighten."
27,2025-09-06,aryan,"It’s the weekend, but that doesn’t mean rest. It means overthinking, over-scrolling, over-isolating. I stayed in bed till noon, skipping breakfast again. I keep telling myself I’ll study later, but I don’t. I scroll through people’s stories and wonder how they’re doing so much — internships, clubs, new friends. I feel stuck in slow motion. My friends from school barely message now; I guess I’ve become too distant. I thought college would be exciting — new beginnings, freedom. But all I feel is pressure and loneliness. It’s not what I expected."
28,2025-09-07,aryan,"I tried journaling today, just to get my thoughts out. It felt weird, but also like talking to someone who won’t judge. I didn’t do much else — just washed my clothes, cleaned a bit. Small wins, maybe. I still didn’t eat properly, but at least I took a shower. That counts, right? I keep thinking I should reach out to the college counselor, but I don’t want to seem weak. Yet deep down, I know I need to talk. I don’t want to feel like this every week. I just want to feel normal again."

69,2025-09-04,student_123,"It’s the weekend, but that doesn’t mean rest. It means overthinking, over-scrolling, over-isolating. I stayed in bed till noon, skipping breakfast again. I keep telling myself I’ll study later, but I don’t. I scroll through people’s stories and wonder how they’re doing so much — internships, clubs, new friends. I feel stuck in slow motion. My friends from school barely message now; I guess I’ve become too distant. I thought college would be exciting — new beginnings, freedom. But all I feel is pressure and loneliness. It’s not what I expected."
70,2025-09-05,student_123,"I tried journaling today, just to get my thoughts out. It felt weird, but also like talking to someone who won’t judge. I didn’t do much else — just washed my clothes, cleaned a bit. Small wins, maybe. I still didn’t eat properly, but at least I took a shower. That counts, right? I keep thinking I should reach out to the college counselor, but I don’t want to seem weak. Yet deep down, I know I need to talk. I don’t want to feel like this every week. I just want to feel normal again."

I didn’t do much else — just washed my clothes, cleaned a bit. Small wins, maybe. I still didn’t eat properly, but at least I took a shower. That counts, right? I keep thinking I should reach out to the college counselor, but I don’t want to seem weak. Yet deep down, I know I need to talk. I don’t want to feel like this every week. I just want to feel normal again."
116,2025-08-31,student_12,"It’s the weekend, but that doesn’t mean rest. It means overthinking, over-scrolling, over-isolating. I stayed in bed till noon, skipping breakfast again. I keep telling myself I’ll study later, but I don’t. I scroll through people’s stories and wonder how they’re doing so much — internships, clubs, new friends. I feel stuck in slow motion. My friends from school barely message now; I guess I’ve become too distant. I thought college would be exciting — new beginnings, freedom. But all I feel is pressure and loneliness. It’s not what I expected."
117,2025-09-01,student_12,"Classes ended early today, and everyone went out for chai and samosas. I wanted to join but couldn’t get myself to move. I watched them from my window, laughing like everything’s fine. I miss feeling like that. I finally opened up a YouTube tutorial and tried coding something small, and for a moment, I felt… not happy, but focused. It didn’t last long, but it was better than nothing. Maybe I need help. Maybe I should talk to someone. But the thought of even starting that conversation makes my chest tighten."
118,2025-09-02,student_12,"I skipped the first lecture today. Honestly, I didn’t feel like facing anyone. I sat alone at the back of the library for a while, just hiding behind a book I wasn’t reading. My roommate asked if I was okay — I told him I was just tired. It’s easier to lie than explain feelings I don’t fully understand myself. I keep thinking maybe I’m just being dramatic, maybe I’m weak. But this constant heaviness, the way I can’t focus, can’t talk, can’t smile genuinely — it’s real. I wish someone would notice without me having to explain."
119,2025-09-03,student_12,"Midweek, and I already feel drained. My attendance is dipping, but I can’t bring myself to care. I woke up and just stared at the ceiling for almost an hour. When I finally got up, the day felt like a blur. The class was talking about an upcoming coding contest. I smiled and pretended to be interested, but I know I won’t participate. I feel out of place even in my own branch. I used to love computers, but now I don’t even want to open my laptop. Everyone thinks I’m just quiet, but they have no idea what’s going on inside."
120,2025-09-04,student_12,"I thought maybe today would be better, but it wasn’t. I sat through lectures again, nodding as if I understood, but my notes are still just random words. A group from my class asked if I wanted to join their project team, and I said no — not because I didn’t want to, but because I didn’t think I’d contribute anything. I watched from a distance as they laughed and discussed things I couldn’t relate to. I avoided calls from home and stared at my assignment for hours before submitting an incomplete version. Nights feel the worst — quiet, long, and heavy."
121,2025-09-05,student_12,"I woke up late again today, skipped breakfast, and dragged myself to the 8 AM class—half present, half zoned out. Everyone seems to get the lectures except me, and I don’t even have the courage to ask questions. I laughed along with a few classmates just to blend in, but inside I felt empty. Lunch was another skipped meal—I wasn’t really hungry, or maybe I just didn’t feel like sitting around people. Lab sessions were stressful; I barely understood the assignment and copied most of it. I wanted to call my parents but didn’t know what to say. I keep lying to them that things are fine. I scroll through reels and act like everything’s okay, but it’s not. I feel like I’m falling behind—academically, socially, mentally. Everyone looks like they’re moving forward, while I’m stuck pretending to be fine. I don’t know how long I can keep this up."
